## Overview

PeakFinder provides a collection of peak detection algorithms for numerical data represented as arrays or matrices.
It supports multiple algorithmic approaches for one-dimensional and two-dimensional inputs, with a unified interface for higher-dimensional data.
The library offers automatic algorithm selection based on input characteristics, while allowing explicit configuration when a specific method or performance profile is required.

## Installation

### From PyPI (when published)

```bash
pip install peakfinder
```

For visualization support:

```bash
pip install peakfinder[viz]
```

### From Source / Local Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/peakfinder.git
cd peakfinder

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install in editable mode with development tools
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```python
from peakfinder import PeakDetector
import numpy as np

# 1D peak detection
arr = np.array([1, 3, 2, 5, 4])
detector = PeakDetector(arr)
peak_idx = detector.find_any_peak()
print(f"Peak found at index: {peak_idx}")

# 2D peak detection
matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 9, 5], [6, 7, 8]])
detector = PeakDetector(matrix)
row, col = detector.find_peak_2d()
print(f"Peak found at ({row}, {col})")
```

### Finding All Peaks

```python
arr = np.array([1, 5, 2, 6, 3])
detector = PeakDetector(arr)
all_peaks = detector.find_all_peaks()
print(f"Found {len(all_peaks)} peaks at indices: {all_peaks}")
```

### Counting Peaks

```python
arr = np.array([1, 5, 2, 6, 3, 4, 2])
detector = PeakDetector(arr)
count = detector.count_peaks()
print(f"Total peaks: {count}")
```

## Supported Algorithms

### 1D Peak Detection

- **Brute Force** (`mode="brute"`): Linear scan, O(n) time complexity
- **Binary Search** (`mode="binary"`): O(log n) time complexity, best for arrays without duplicates
- **Hybrid** (`mode="hybrid"`): Compresses duplicates then uses binary search, handles duplicates robustly
- **Auto** (`mode="auto"`): Automatically selects the best algorithm based on data properties

### 2D Peak Detection

- **Divide-and-Conquer**: O(n log m) time complexity for n×m matrices

### Peak Counting

- **Linear Scan**: O(n) time, suitable for single queries
- **Segment Tree**: O(n) preprocessing, O(log n) per query, optimal for repeated range queries

## Design Philosophy

PeakFinder is designed with the following principles:

1. **Simplicity**: Clean, intuitive API that hides algorithmic complexity
2. **Robustness**: Handles edge cases, duplicates, and invalid inputs gracefully
3. **Performance**: Automatic algorithm selection optimizes for your use case
4. **Extensibility**: Well-structured codebase allows easy addition of new algorithms
5. **Documentation**: Comprehensive docs and examples for all features
6. **API Stability**: Public APIs follow semantic versioning.

## Error Handling

PeakFinder performs strict input validation and raises explicit exceptions for:

* Unsupported data types or shapes
* Invalid dimensionality for a selected algorithm
* Ambiguous peak definitions when strict criteria are required

---

## Determinism and Thread Safety

* Algorithms are deterministic
* No global mutable state is used
* `PeakDetector` instances are safe for concurrent read-only use

## Performance Characteristics

### 1D Peak Detection

| Algorithm | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Best For |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|----------|
| Brute Force | O(n) | O(1) | Small arrays, simple cases |
| Binary Search | O(log n) | O(1) | Large arrays without duplicates |
| Hybrid | O(n) worst, O(log n) best | O(n) worst, O(1) best | Arrays with duplicates |

### 2D Peak Detection

- **Time**: O(n log m) for n×m matrix
- **Space**: O(log m) for recursion stack

### Peak Counting

- **Linear**: O(n) per query
- **Segment Tree**: O(n) preprocessing, O(log n) per query

## API Reference

### PeakDetector

Main interface for peak detection.

```python
detector = PeakDetector(
    data,                    # array-like: Input data
    allow_duplicates=True,     # bool: Handle duplicate values
    mode="auto"              # str: Algorithm mode
)
```

#### Methods

- `find_any_peak()`: Find any peak in the data
- `find_all_peaks()`: Find all peaks (1D only)
- `count_peaks(use_segment_tree=False)`: Count peaks (1D only)
- `find_peak_2d()`: Find peak in 2D data
- `find_peak_nd()`: Find peak in N-dimensional data

#### Properties

- `data`: Underlying numpy array
- `shape`: Shape of the data
- `ndim`: Number of dimensions

## Examples

### Example 1: Signal Processing

```python
import numpy as np
from peakfinder import PeakDetector

# Simulate a signal with noise
signal = np.sin(np.linspace(0, 4*np.pi, 100)) + np.random.normal(0, 0.1, 100)
detector = PeakDetector(signal)
peaks = detector.find_all_peaks()
print(f"Found {len(peaks)} peaks in signal")
```

### Example 2: Image Analysis

```python
import numpy as np
from peakfinder import PeakDetector

# Find peak intensity in an image
image = np.random.rand(100, 100) * 255
detector = PeakDetector(image)
row, col = detector.find_peak_2d()
print(f"Peak intensity at pixel ({row}, {col})")
```

### Example 3: Visualization

```python
import numpy as np
from peakfinder import PeakDetector
from peakfinder.visualization import plot_1d_peaks

arr = np.array([1, 5, 2, 6, 3, 4, 2])
detector = PeakDetector(arr)
peaks = detector.find_all_peaks()
plot_1d_peaks(arr, peaks=peaks, show_all=True)
```
